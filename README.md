# LoRa-Based Cloud-Integrated Weather Monitoring System

This project collects real-time temperature and humidity readings using LoRa-based wireless communication. The data is displayed on a 16×2 LCD and simultaneously pushed to a cloud platform for remote monitoring through a web/mobile interface.

## 🔧 Features
- Long-range wireless transmission using LoRa  
- Real-time sensor data collection (Temperature & Humidity)  
- 16×2 LCD live display  
- Cloud integration for remote access  
- Upgraded academic project with improved architecture
